                    <p><h4 class="heading heading-h4 CerebriSans-font" style="font-family:CerebriSans;text-transform:capitalize">Paid Services</h4></p>
                    <p>These  Terms for Paid Services (the “Paid Service Terms”) apply to your purchase and use of any paid BioBay services, including automatically renewing subscription. <p>
                    <p>By purchasing or using a Paid Service, you agree to be bound by the Terms of Service, which incorporate these Paid Service Terms and include a mandatory arbitration provision, and any separate terms and conditions presented to you in conjunction with your use of the Paid Services.

                    <p>SUBSCRIPTIONS<p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight:600;text-transform:capitalize">Automatically Renewing Subscriptions.</span><br> Your Subscription term may vary, for example, with monthly or annual automatic renewal terms (a “Subscription Term”), as described in the course of your transaction. Your Subscription will automatically renew for additional Subscription Terms as long as your Subscription continues, until you cancel it or we suspend or stop providing the Subscription in accordance with our Terms of Service. Unless otherwise indicated by us, you will be charged prior to, or at the beginning of, each renewal term. Before charging you for a Subscription Term, we will notify you of the applicable fees, and the renewal will occur at the price then in effect for the Paid Service.</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight:600;text-transform:capitalize">Subscription Cancellation.</span><br> You may cancel your Subscription at any time. Your cancellation will take effect at the end of the current Subscription Term.</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight:600;text-transform:capitalize">No Refunds on Subscriptions.</span><br> When you cancel a Subscription, you cancel only future charges for your Subscription.

                    <p><span style="font-weight:600;text-transform:capitalize">Free Trials.</span><br> From time to time, we may offer free trials of certain Subscriptions for specified periods of time without payment.

Once your free trial ends, we (or our third-party payment processor) will begin billing your designated payment method on a recurring basis for your Subscription (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) for as long as your Subscription continues, unless you cancel your Subscription prior to the end of your free trial. Instructions for canceling your Subscription are described in the sections above. To avoid any charges, you must cancel your Subscription before the end of your free trial period. Before charging you at the end of the your free trial period, we will notify you of the applicable fees.</p>

                      <p><h4 class="heading heading-h4 CerebriSans-font" style="font-family:CerebriSans;text-transform:capitalize">Arbitration Agreement</h4></p>
                      <p>You and Calibri agree to the arbitration and dispute resolution terms in this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”).  For the purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, references to “Calibri,” “you,” “we” and “us” include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, employers, partners, shareholders, predecessors in interest, successors, assigns, and heirs.  We encourage you to read these important terms, which include an arbitration requirement (except for small claims) and require claims to be brought individually, and include instructions for how to opt out if you do not agree. </p>
                      <p><span style="font-weight:600;text-transform:capitalize">Applicability</span><br>
                        You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Calibri Service, mobile apps, and service, or to any aspect of your relationship with Calibri, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.</p>
                      <p><span style="font-weight:600;text-transform:capitalize">Arbitration rules and forum</span><br>
                      The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Calibri Inc., 2633 Lincoln Blvd #134, Santa Monica, CA 90405 .The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.  JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.  If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person or at another mutually agreed location.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                      <p><span style="font-weight:600;text-transform:capitalize">Authority of arbitrator</span><br>
                        The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Calibri.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. </p>
                      <p><span style="font-weight:600;text-transform:capitalize">Waiver of jury trial</span><br>
                        YOU AND CALIBRI HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.  </p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight:600;text-transform:capitalize">Waiver of class or other non-individualized relief</span><br>
                      ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the federal or state court located in San Diego, California.  All other claims shall be arbitrated. </p>
                     <p><span style="font-weight:600;text-transform:capitalize">30-day right to opt out</span><br>
                      You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Agreement that mandate arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to:info@findbenji.com within 30 days after first becoming subject to a version of this Agreement containing an arbitration provision.  Your notice must include your name and address, your Calibri username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Calibri account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.  If you opt out of arbitration, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.  Opting out of arbitration has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p>
                      <p><span style="font-weight:600;text-transform:capitalize">Survival of agreement</span><br>
                      This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Calibri.</p>
                      <p><span style="font-weight:600;text-transform:capitalize">Modification</span><br>
                      Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Calibri makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing Calibri at the following address: Calibri Inc., 2633 Lincoln Blvd #134, Santa Monica, CA 90405</p>
