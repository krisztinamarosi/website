              <li>if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Calibri, our employees, our users or the public;</li>
              <li>in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, acquisition, divestiture, bankruptcy, dissolution, or other transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer or divestiture of all or a portion of our business or assets to another company, to the extent permitted under applicable law;</li>

              </ul>
              <p>We may allow others to provide analytics services and/or serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These entities may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other similar technologies to collect information about your use of our websites and third-party websites.</p>
              <p>We do not disclose Survey Information or PHI to third parties for marketing, advertising, data mining or other purposes.</p>

              <p>Calibri Inc. takes reasonable measures designed to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or through mobile applications is 100% safe. Therefore, although we use commercially reasonable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
              <br><div><h3 class="heading heading-h3 CerebriSans-font" style="font-family:CerebriSans;text-transform:capitalize">Information Retention</h3><br></div>
              <p>We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different information types in the context of different products, actual retention periods can vary based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the information, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete information, and our legal or contractual obligations.</p>

              <p><h4 class="heading heading-h4 CerebriSans-font; " style="font-family:CerebriSans;text-transform:capitalize">Location Information</h4></p>
              <p>When you first install or launch any of our mobile applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application’s collection of this information. We require location information to use certain features of our Services, so if you do not consent to this collection, you cannot use those features.

If you do so, certain features of our mobile applications will no longer function. You may also stop our collection of location information by following the standard uninstall process to remove our mobile application from your device.</p>

              <p><h4 class="heading heading-h4 CerebriSans-font; " style="font-family:CerebriSans;text-transform:capitalize">Cookies</h4></p>
              <p>Most browsers let you remove and/or stop accepting cookies from the websites you visit. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser’s settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all functionality of the Service and the Service may not work properly.

              <br><div><h3 class="heading heading-h3 CerebriSans-font" style="font-family:CerebriSans;text-transform:capitalize">California Privacy Rights & Notices</h3><br></div>
              <p>If the processing of your personal information is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), you have certain rights with respect to that information:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Right to Know. You can request access to the personal information we collected about you in the last 12 months. You can also request information about the categories of personal information we collected, the sources of collection, the purposes for collection and sharing of this information, the categories of information we shared, and the categories of third parties with whom we shared this information. Note that we have provided much of this information above in this Privacy Policy.</li>
              <li>Right to Request Deletion. You can request that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions.</li>
              <li>Right to Opt-Out. You can opt-out from any sharing of your personal information with third parties to the extent that such sharing constitutes a “sale” of that data under the CCPA.</li>
              <li>Right to Non-Discrimination. You will not be discriminated against by Calibri for exercising rights set out in the CCPA.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In the past 12 months, we have disclosed, for a business purpose, data from each of the categories of personal information we maintain to our business partners, as described above.</p>
              <p>The CCPA defines the “sale” of personal information very broadly, and some of our use of third-party cookies and tracking technologies as described in this Privacy Policy may be considered a “sale” under that definition. Specifically, in the past 12 months, we have allowed our advertising and analytics providers to collect IP addresses, cookie IDs, and mobile IDs through our sites and apps when you use our online services. We do not otherwise “sell” personal information.</p>
              <br><div><h3 class="heading heading-h3 CerebriSans-font" style="font-family:CerebriSans;text-transform:capitalize">Other Sites and Services</h3><br></div>
              <p>The Service may contain links to websites, mobile applications, and other online services operated by third parties.  These links are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party.  In addition, our content may be included on web pages or in mobile applications or other online services that are not associated with us. We do not control websites, mobile applications or online services operated by third parties, and we are not responsible for their actions.  </p>
              <br><div><h3 class="heading heading-h3 CerebriSans-font" style="font-family:CerebriSans;text-transform:capitalize">Children</h3><br></div>
              <p>The Service is not intended for use by children under 18 years of age. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 18 without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian as required by law, we will delete it. </p>
              <br><div><h3 class="heading heading-h3 CerebriSans-font" style="font-family:CerebriSans;text-transform:capitalize">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3><br></div>
              <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on the Service. If required by law we will also provide notification of changes in another way that we believe is reasonably likely to reach you, such as via email or another manner through the Service.  Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting the modified version (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all cases, your continued use of the Service after the effective date of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the modified Privacy Policy.</p>
